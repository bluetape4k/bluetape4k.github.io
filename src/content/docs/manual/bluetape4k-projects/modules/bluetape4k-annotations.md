## Problem

Kotlin visibility cannot express every compatibility boundary. A declaration may need to stay public for inlining or framework integration while still being unsafe to call, unstable to implement, or scheduled for removal. `bluetape4k-annotations` makes that boundary visible to the compiler with `@RequiresOptIn` markers.

## When to use

Use a marker when a public declaration needs a contract stronger than prose. Choose `BluetapeExperimentalApi` for unstable use sites, `BluetapeInternalApi` for technically public internals, `BluetapeDelicateApi` for lifecycle or security-sensitive calls, `BluetapeObsoleteApi` for migration-only APIs, and `BluetapeBetaApi` for APIs expected to stabilize. Use `BluetapeImplementationApi` on SPI types that are safe to call but not yet safe to subclass.

Do not annotate a stable API merely to avoid compatibility work. If the restriction can be represented with Kotlin visibility, prefer visibility.

## Coordinates

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.bluetape4k:bluetape4k-bom:<version>"))
    implementation("io.github.bluetape4k:bluetape4k-annotations")
}
```

The annotations have binary retention, so downstream compilation sees them without adding runtime behavior.

## Concepts

Error-level markers (`Experimental`, `Internal`, `Obsolete`) require explicit `@OptIn`. Warning-level markers (`Beta`, `Delicate`) surface risk while allowing compilation. `BluetapeImplementationApi` uses `@SubclassOptInRequired`, which separates “calling an interface” from “implementing the interface.”

## Quick start

```kotlin
import io.bluetape4k.annotations.BluetapeExperimentalApi

@BluetapeExperimentalApi
fun unstablePlan(): String = "draft"

@OptIn(BluetapeExperimentalApi::class)
fun evaluateDraft(): String = unstablePlan()
```

Keep the opt-in scope as narrow as practical; a file-level opt-in can hide unrelated unstable calls.

## API by task

| Task | Marker |
| --- | --- |
| Publish an API that may change without compatibility guarantees | `BluetapeExperimentalApi` |
| Expose a declaration only for technical reasons | `BluetapeInternalApi` |
| Warn about lifecycle, concurrency, resource, or security obligations | `BluetapeDelicateApi` |
| Keep an API only for migration | `BluetapeObsoleteApi` |
| Signal a likely-to-stabilize API | `BluetapeBetaApi` |
| Allow calls but restrict third-party implementations | `BluetapeImplementationApi` |

## Patterns

Put the marker on the declaration that owns the unstable contract. Propagation is intentional: a public wrapper around an experimental API should either opt in internally and expose a stable contract, or carry the marker itself. For SPI, annotate the base class or interface so implementations—not callers—receive the warning.

## Integrations

The module depends only on Kotlin annotation semantics and can be used by every other bluetape4k module. Java callers see the annotation metadata but do not receive Kotlin's opt-in diagnostics, so Java-facing documentation must still state the restriction.

## Configuration

There is no runtime configuration. Build configuration consists of dependency selection and, when deliberately accepting a contract across a bounded source set, Kotlin compiler opt-in flags. Prefer source-level `@OptIn` because it records the exact acceptance site.

## Failures

Error-level markers fail Kotlin compilation when a use site has not opted in. Warning-level markers emit diagnostics. Removing a marker annotation class can break downstream source that names it in `@OptIn`, even after all bluetape4k declarations stop using that marker.

## Operations

The artifact adds no threads, I/O, allocation lifecycle, or runtime service. Its operational risk is compatibility governance: teams should review opt-ins during upgrades instead of suppressing them globally and forgetting the accepted risk.

## Testing

`BluetapeApiMarkersTest` verifies retention, targets, diagnostic level, and the special subclass opt-in contract. Run:

```bash
./gradlew :bluetape4k-annotations:test --no-configuration-cache
```

## Workshops

No dedicated workshop is registered. The smallest useful experiment is a two-module build where one module publishes a marked declaration and the other verifies the expected compiler diagnostic and narrow `@OptIn` fix.

## Limitations

Markers communicate policy; they do not provide binary compatibility analysis or enforce contracts for Java callers. They also do not replace deprecation annotations when a replacement API and migration message exist.
