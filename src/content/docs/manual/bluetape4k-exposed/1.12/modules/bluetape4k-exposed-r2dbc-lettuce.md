This adapter combines coroutine-first R2DBC with Redis through Lettuce. It implements the common cache repository contract without hiding lifecycle or durability choices.

## Problem

Cache and database state can diverge when a miss, write, invalidation, timeout, cancellation, or shutdown completes only partly. The adapter supplies the integration; the application still defines acceptable staleness and failure behavior.

## When to use it

Use this module when Redis through Lettuce is the chosen backend and the persistence path is coroutine-first R2DBC. Compare all six adapters in the [cache selection guide](/manual/bluetape4k-exposed/1.12/guides/cache-selection/) before adding infrastructure.

## Coordinates

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.bluetape4k:bluetape4k-dependencies:<version>"))
    implementation("io.github.bluetape4k.exposed:bluetape4k-exposed-r2dbc-lettuce")
}
```

## Core concepts

`get` and `getAll` are read-through operations. Cache-aside is an application-owned DB update followed by invalidation. True write-through requires the configured writer to finish DB persistence before returning. Write-behind accepts a delayed durability window. Ordinary `put` must not be called write-through without that writer policy. This adapter is when enabled, lookup proceeds Caffeine near cache, Redis, then the R2DBC loader; invalidation must clear both tiers.

## Quick start

Extend `AbstractR2dbcLettuceRepository` and provide `table`, `extractId`, `ResultRow.toEntity`, and the update/insert DSL hooks. Construct it with a reviewed `LettuceCacheConfig`.

```kotlin
repository.use { repo ->
    val current = repo.get(id)          // miss -> DB loader -> cache
    current?.let { repo.put(id, it) }   // durability follows write mode
    repo.invalidate(id)                 // cache-only by default
}
```

## API by task

| Task | API |
| --- | --- |
| Cache-backed read | `containsKey`, `get`, `getAll` |
| DB bypass | `findByIdFromDb`, `findAllFromDb`, `countFromDb` |
| Policy-controlled write | `put`, `putAll` |
| Eviction | `invalidate`, `invalidateAll`, `clear` |
| Entity mapping | `ResultRow.toEntity`, `extractId`, update/insert hooks |
| Lifecycle | `close` |

## Recommended patterns

Keep one repository per cache namespace and close it with the application. For cache-aside, commit the DB transaction before invalidating. Treat write-through failure as an incomplete write. Before write-behind, expose queue/dead-letter state and define the shutdown drain budget. Keep key prefixes and serialized value formats stable.

## Integrations

The module joins Exposed R2DBC, the shared cache foundation, and Redis through Lettuce. Loader/writer adapters own the cache-to-table bridge; the application owns the surrounding service transaction and client lifecycle.

## Configuration

`LettuceCacheConfig` controls namespace, TTL/expiry, cache/write mode, and backend limits. An explicit `RedisCodec<String, E>` is required; plan migration before changing it. Validate positive durations and bounded batch/queue sizes at startup.

## Failure modes

Coroutine cancellation, Redis timeout, and DB retry are distinct failures. Write-behind returns before the DB transaction commits. A cache hit can be stale, a backend success can be followed by DB failure, and DB commit can be followed by failed invalidation. Record these as distinct states.

## Operations

The application owns `RedisClient`; the repository closes its connection and optional near cache. Monitor hit/miss, backend latency, retries/timeouts, queue depth, rejected or dead-letter writes, invalidation lag, and shutdown drain. Set separate SLOs for cache and database paths.

## Testing

Use isolated cache and database fixtures with unique namespaces. Prove miss loading, partial `getAll` misses, each enabled write mode, cache-only invalidation, TTL, partial failure, and lifecycle cleanup.

```bash
./gradlew :bluetape4k-exposed-r2dbc-lettuce:test
```

## Workshops and learning path

1. Read [Exposed cache foundation](/manual/bluetape4k-exposed/1.12/modules/bluetape4k-exposed-cache/).
2. Choose a backend in [cache selection](/manual/bluetape4k-exposed/1.12/guides/cache-selection/).
3. Implement read-through plus cache-only invalidation first.
4. Add partial-failure and shutdown tests before near cache or write-behind.
5. Continue with [exposed-workshop](https://github.com/bluetape4k/exposed-workshop).

## Limitations

The adapter does not create a distributed transaction, provision the backend, migrate stored cache values, or decide whether stale data is safe. It is when enabled, lookup proceeds Caffeine near cache, Redis, then the R2DBC loader; invalidation must clear both tiers.
