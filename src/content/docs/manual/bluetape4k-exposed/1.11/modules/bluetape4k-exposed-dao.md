> Identity, string-ID, generated-ID, and audit conventions for Exposed DAO entities.

## Problem

Exposed DAO entities are transaction-bound objects. Equality, string rendering, generated-ID entity classes, and audit updates are easy to implement inconsistently. This module provides a small shared convention layer above Exposed DAO.

## When to use it

Use it when the domain persistence model intentionally uses Exposed `Entity`/`EntityClass`. Prefer record/DTO mapping through the JDBC or R2DBC repositories when values must leave the transaction boundary.

## Coordinates

`io.github.bluetape4k.exposed:bluetape4k-exposed-dao`, managed by `io.github.bluetape4k:bluetape4k-dependencies:<version>`.

## Core concepts

- `idEquals`, `idHashCode`, and entity string builders make identity handling explicit.
- `StringEntity` and generated-ID entity families pair with core ID tables.
- `AuditableEntity` sets actor fields, but `updatedAt` is guaranteed only by audited JDBC repository updates.
- A DAO entity remains attached to the active Exposed transaction.

## Quick start

```kotlin
class Customer(id: EntityID<String>) : StringEntity(id) {
    companion object : StringEntityClass<Customer>(Customers)
    var name by Customers.name
}
```

Read lazy relations and convert the entity to a detached DTO before the transaction closes.

## API by task

| Task | API |
|---|---|
| Identity equality/hash | `idEquals`, `idHashCode` |
| Diagnostic text | `toStringBuilder`, `entityToStringBuilder` |
| String IDs | `StringEntity`, `StringEntityClass` |
| Generated IDs | KSUID, ULID, Snowflake, time-based UUID entity families |
| Audit actor fields | `AuditableEntity` and typed variants |

## Recommended patterns

Keep DAO access and lazy traversal inside one caller-owned JDBC transaction. Map to immutable output values at that boundary. Avoid returning an `Entity` from a service and touching it later.

## Integrations

DAO builds on core and Exposed DAO, with JDBC available at runtime. The JDBC repository module can share the same table declarations.

## Configuration

No standalone configuration exists. Configure Exposed's database/transaction layer and bind `UserContext` where audit actor fields are needed.

## Failure modes

Detached/lazy access can fail after the transaction closes. Generic entity updates do not guarantee `updatedAt`. Identity comparison before an entity has a stable ID must be treated carefully.

## Operations

Keep transaction duration bounded and avoid logging lazy properties that trigger unexpected queries. Monitor query count when traversing relations.

## Testing

Use a real transaction and database fixture. Assert detached DTO values after mapping, audit actor behavior, and ID-family persistence across the dialects you support.

## Workshops and learning path

Read [Mapping conventions](/manual/bluetape4k-exposed/1.11/modules/bluetape4k-exposed-core/mapping-conventions/), then choose the [JDBC repository path](/manual/bluetape4k-exposed/1.11/modules/bluetape4k-exposed-jdbc/). Exposed DAO is not the R2DBC entity model.

## Limitations

This module does not make DAO entities detached, reactive, or safe outside a transaction. It does not own transaction creation.
