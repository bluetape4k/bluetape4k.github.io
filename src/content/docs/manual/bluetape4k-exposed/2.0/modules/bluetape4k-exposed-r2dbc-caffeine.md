This adapter combines coroutine-first R2DBC with in-process Caffeine AsyncCache. It implements the common cache repository contract without hiding lifecycle or durability choices.

## Problem

Cache and database state can diverge when a miss, write, invalidation, timeout, cancellation, or shutdown completes only partly. The adapter supplies the integration; the application still defines acceptable staleness and failure behavior.

## When to use it

Use this module when in-process Caffeine AsyncCache is the chosen backend and the persistence path is coroutine-first R2DBC. Compare all six adapters in the [cache selection guide](/manual/bluetape4k-exposed/2.0/guides/cache-selection/) before adding infrastructure.

## Coordinates

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.bluetape4k:bluetape4k-dependencies:<version>"))
    implementation("io.github.bluetape4k.exposed:bluetape4k-exposed-r2dbc-caffeine")
}
```

## Core concepts

`get` and `getAll` are read-through operations. Cache-aside is an application-owned DB update followed by invalidation. True write-through requires the configured writer to finish DB persistence before returning. Write-behind accepts a delayed durability window. Ordinary `put` must not be called write-through without that writer policy. This adapter is local-only; it has no distributed invalidation.

The stable `2.0.0` adapter owns its R2DBC transactions, coroutine scope, and `AsyncCache`; write-behind remains an explicitly delayed durability mode. The lifecycle coordinator, bounded admission accounting, publication lease, and terminal retry behavior described below are part of the stable `2.0.0` contract.

**2.0.0 write-behind contract:** `writeBehindBatchSize` and `writeBehindQueueCapacity` must each be in `1..100_000`, and queue capacity must be greater than or equal to batch size. Zero, negative, values above `100_000`, or a queue smaller than the batch fail fast with `IllegalArgumentException`. A failed flush is retried at most 8 times with capped exponential backoff from 10 ms to 1 s; the retained batch is not dropped before the retry limit. A terminal failure leaves the worker in `FAILED`; the library does not silently move the retained batch to a durable outbox or dead-letter store.

## Quick start

Extend `AbstractR2dbcCaffeineRepository` and provide `table`, `extractId`, `ResultRow.toEntity`, and the update/insert DSL hooks. Construct it with a reviewed `LocalCacheConfig`.

```kotlin
repository.use { repo ->
    val current = repo.get(id)          // miss -> DB loader -> cache
    current?.let { repo.put(id, it) }   // durability follows write mode
    repo.invalidate(id)                 // cache-only by default
}
```

## API by task

| Task | API |
| --- | --- |
| Cache-backed read | `containsKey`, `get`, `getAll` |
| DB bypass | `findByIdFromDb`, `findAllFromDb`, `countFromDb` |
| Policy-controlled write | `put`, `putAll` |
| Eviction | `invalidate`, `invalidateAll`, `clear` |
| Entity mapping | `ResultRow.toEntity`, `extractId`, update/insert hooks |
| Lifecycle | `close` |

## Recommended patterns

Keep one repository per cache namespace and close it with the application. For cache-aside, commit the DB transaction before invalidating. Treat write-through failure as an incomplete write. Before write-behind, expose queue state and define the shutdown drain budget. `putAll` processes entries in input order; if an entry fails, earlier effects remain visible and the exception identifies the failing operation—there is no implicit rollback. After an accepted queue handoff, a cache publication failure invalidates that key. Keep key prefixes and serialized value formats stable.

## Integrations

The module joins Exposed R2DBC, the shared cache foundation, and in-process Caffeine AsyncCache. Loader/writer adapters own the cache-to-table bridge; the application owns the surrounding service transaction and client lifecycle.

## Configuration

`LocalCacheConfig` controls namespace, TTL/expiry, cache/write mode, and backend limits. Values remain local; entity mapping and repository operations are suspend functions. Validate positive durations and bounded batch/queue sizes at startup.

## Failure modes

Caller cancellation can happen while cache or R2DBC work is in flight. Write-behind acknowledgement does not mean the DB has committed. A cache hit can be stale, a backend success can be followed by DB failure, and DB commit can be followed by failed invalidation. Record these as distinct states.

## Operations

The repository owns the async cache and bounded write-behind scope; close it during application shutdown. In the develop implementation, `close()` first stops new admissions, attempts publication and worker drain within a finite shutdown boundary, and then invalidates the cache; timeout or interruption can leave a residual batch or failure for operators to observe. Monitor hit/miss, backend latency, retries/timeouts, queue depth, rejected writes, invalidation lag, and shutdown drain. For durable retry or dead-letter recovery, the application must own the outbox schema, replay/idempotency policy, alerting, and operator runbook; coordinator `FAILED` is an observation boundary, not a durable recovery mechanism. Set separate SLOs for cache and database paths.

## Testing

Use isolated cache and database fixtures with unique namespaces. Prove miss loading, partial `getAll` misses, each enabled write mode, cache-only invalidation, TTL, partial failure, and lifecycle cleanup.

```bash
./gradlew :bluetape4k-exposed-r2dbc-caffeine:test
```

## Workshops and learning path

1. Read [Exposed cache foundation](/manual/bluetape4k-exposed/2.0/modules/bluetape4k-exposed-cache/).
2. Choose a backend in [cache selection](/manual/bluetape4k-exposed/2.0/guides/cache-selection/).
3. Implement read-through plus cache-only invalidation first.
4. Add partial-failure and shutdown tests before near cache or write-behind.
5. Continue with [exposed-workshop](https://github.com/bluetape4k/exposed-workshop).

## Limitations

The adapter does not create a distributed transaction, provision the backend, migrate stored cache values, or decide whether stale data is safe. It is local-only; it has no distributed invalidation.
