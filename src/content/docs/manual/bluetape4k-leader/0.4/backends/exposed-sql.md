Use JDBC for blocking services and R2DBC for coroutine-native SQL while keeping election transactions short.

## Module split

`leader-exposed-core` owns the shared table and SQL concepts. `leader-exposed-jdbc` supplies blocking/async electors for JDBC data sources. `leader-exposed-r2dbc` supplies suspend electors for Exposed R2DBC. Supported examples cover H2, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.

## Operational model

Election rows hold owner and expiry metadata; acquisition and release are short database operations, not a transaction around the business action. Keep the action outside the election transaction, provision a connection pool for contender bursts, and prefer database time when clock consistency matters.

## Choice

Choose JDBC when the service and transaction stack are blocking. Choose R2DBC when the call path is coroutine-native and avoiding blocking bridges matters. SQL latency is sensitive to network and container setup, so treat bundled H2 rows as local-layer baselines rather than distributed database evidence.
