## Problem

> **Preview:** Validate API and operational behavior before production adoption.

Preview backend using Consul sessions and KV acquire/release for single and fixed-slot group election. It supports blocking, future, coroutine, and Spring factory surfaces.

## When to use it

Use it when Consul is already operated and its session model fits the job. Do not add Consul solely for election without accepting its ACL, session, and watch operations.

## Coordinates

Artifact: `io.github.bluetape4k.leader:bluetape4k-leader-consul`

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.bluetape4k:bluetape4k-dependencies:<version>"))
    implementation("io.github.bluetape4k.leader:bluetape4k-leader-consul")
}
```

## Core concepts

A session owns an encoded KV key. Session TTL is 10–86,400 seconds; default `lockDelay` is zero, so expiry may permit overlap with a still-running old holder.

## Quick start

```kotlin
val elector = ConsulLeaderElector(
    ConsulEndpoint("http://localhost:8500"),
    ConsulLeaderElectionOptions(
        leaderOptions = LeaderElectionOptions(leaseTime = 10.seconds)
    )
)
elector.runIfLeader("daily-report") { generateReport() }
```

## API by task

Use `ConsulLeaderElector`/group for blocking code and `ConsulSuspendLeaderElector`/group for coroutines. Caller-owned `ConsulEndpoint` carries URL, datacenter, token, and timeout.

## Recommended patterns

Use an application-specific key prefix, least-privilege ACLs, idempotent actions, and external fencing if overlap is unacceptable.

## Integrations

Spring creates factories from a caller-owned `ConsulEndpoint`. Core listener decorators work, but long-lived blocking-query watches remain application-owned.

## Configuration

Set key/session prefixes, request timeout, TTL-range lease, wait time, group size, and `lockDelay`. The client/session environment is caller-owned.

## Failure modes

Contention skips. HTTP, ACL, session, or timeout failures propagate. With zero lock delay, expired ownership can overlap until the old process stops.

## Operations

Monitor session renewals, KV latency, ACL failures, orphan sessions, and skip rate. Include datacenter and prefix in runbooks.

## Testing

Use Consul integration tests for single/group and blocking/suspend paths; test TTL bounds, owner payload, failure classification, and release.

## Workshops and learning path

Run the consul-maintenance example, then compare Consul with etcd and ZooKeeper by ownership and failure semantics.

## Limitations

Preview status means API/operations may change. Consul's lock is a lease, not fencing; the endpoint and agent lifecycle are not managed by the library.
