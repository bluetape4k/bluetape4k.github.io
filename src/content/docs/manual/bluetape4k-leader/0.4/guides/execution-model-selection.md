Keep the elector API aligned with the application's concurrency model and cancellation rules.

## Blocking and CompletableFuture

`LeaderElector` runs a synchronous lambda on the caller path. `AsyncLeaderElector` accepts a `CompletableFuture` action and defaults to the virtual-thread executor. Use blocking APIs for bounded imperative jobs; use the async API when the surrounding contract already exposes futures.

## Virtual threads

`VirtualThreadLeaderElector` accepts a direct lambda and returns `VirtualFuture`. It is useful for many blocking election attempts on Java 21+, but it does not turn blocking backend calls into non-blocking I/O. Size backend connections independently.

## Coroutines

`SuspendLeaderElector` is the natural choice in coroutine services. Use native suspend backends such as Exposed R2DBC when end-to-end non-blocking behavior matters. Do not bridge a suspend-only delegate through `runBlocking`; cancellation must release the scoped lease and propagate.

## Result and cancellation

All models offer explicit result variants. Cancellation is not converted to `ActionFailed`: blocking and suspend paths rethrow it, while future-based paths complete exceptionally. Test the observation point your caller actually uses, such as `await()` or `join()`.
