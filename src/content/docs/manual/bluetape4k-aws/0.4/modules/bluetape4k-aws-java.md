## Problem

Kotlin builders and sync, `CompletableFuture`, and coroutine APIs over AWS SDK for Java v2 clients.

## When to use it

Choose it when the application uses Java SDK v2 clients, needs both blocking and asynchronous paths, or integrates with Spring Boot.

## Coordinates

Applications select one central BOM version.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.bluetape4k:bluetape4k-dependencies:<version>"))
    implementation("io.github.bluetape4k.aws:bluetape4k-aws-java")
}
```

AWS service SDKs follow a `compileOnly` policy; add the services actually used as runtime dependencies.

## Core concepts

Factories build clients; extensions keep the AWS client type visible; async extensions expose futures; coroutine extensions await those futures. The application owns every created client and must close it.

## Quick start

```kotlin
val s3 = S3AsyncClient.create()
try {
    s3.putAsByteArray(bucket, key, payload)
    val objects = s3.listAllObjects(bucket).toList()
} finally {
    s3.close()
}
```

## API by task

S3 object and transfer helpers, DynamoDB enhanced repositories and batch execution, SQS/SNS messaging, KMS, CloudWatch, Kinesis, SES, STS, and request-model builders.

## Recommended patterns

Put client and background-job ownership at one application boundary. Configure region, credentials, and endpoints once instead of rebuilding them per call.

## Integrations

Spring Boot and Ktor modules build on this library. Add only the Java SDK v2 services used at runtime, for example `software.amazon.awssdk:s3`.

## Configuration

Set region, credentials, endpoint override, HTTP implementation, retry policy, and timeouts on the AWS client builder before sharing the client.

## Failure modes

Blank queue URLs, incomplete S3 pagination, missing service jars, blocking calls on coroutine threads, and leaked async clients are the common failure modes.

## Operations

Reuse thread-safe clients, bound concurrency, monitor retries and throttling, and make copy-then-delete S3 move semantics explicit.

## Testing

Use Floci first with endpoint override and static test credentials; use LocalStack only for service behavior that Floci does not cover.

## Workshops and learning path

Read `client-lifecycle`, then `sync-async-coroutines`, then `service-patterns`; continue with the released S3, DynamoDB, and SQS examples.

## Limitations

The artifact does not bring every AWS service SDK at runtime. Coroutine helpers do not turn synchronous clients into non-blocking clients.
