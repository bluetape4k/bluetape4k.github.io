> Library manual grounded in the 0.5.0 release source.

## Problem

Resolves AWS-backed database settings, creates Hikari data sources and Exposed databases, and manages default or named database handles.

## When to use it

Use it when JDBC connection settings or credentials come from Secrets Manager, Parameter Store, or RDS IAM authentication.

## Coordinates

Applications select one central BOM version.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.bluetape4k:bluetape4k-dependencies:<version>"))
    implementation("io.github.bluetape4k.aws:bluetape4k-aws-exposed")
}
```

AWS service SDKs follow a `compileOnly` policy; add the services actually used as runtime dependencies.

## Core concepts

A config source identifies where settings live; a resolver returns concrete properties; the data-source factory creates Hikari; the database factory connects Exposed and returns a closeable handle.

## Quick start

```kotlin
val factory = AwsExposedDatabaseFactory(resolver, dataSourceFactory)
val handle = factory.create("orders", properties)
try {
    transaction(handle.database) { Orders.selectAll().count() }
} finally {
    handle.close()
}
```

## API by task

`AwsDatabaseProperties`, `AwsDatabaseSettingsResolver`, `AwsJdbcDataSourceFactory`, `AwsExposedDatabaseFactory`, `AwsExposedDatabaseRegistry`, and RDS IAM authentication support.

## Recommended patterns

Put client and background-job ownership at one application boundary. Configure region, credentials, and endpoints once instead of rebuilding them per call.

## Integrations

Spring Boot auto-configuration and Ktor's Exposed plugin consume this foundation. Add the required Secrets Manager, SSM, RDS, JDBC driver, Hikari, and Exposed runtime modules.

## Configuration

Keep secrets out of static configuration. Configure source, region, secret/parameter identifier, JDBC driver and URL shape, pool size, and IAM token refresh behavior.

## Failure modes

Malformed secret payloads, missing driver jars, expired IAM tokens, wrong region, and pool ownership mistakes surface during resolution or first connection.

## Operations

Resolve settings before serving traffic, bound pool size, rotate credentials outside transactions, and close every handle during application shutdown.

## Testing

Use fake resolvers for unit tests and an emulator or disposable database for resolution-plus-connection tests. Assert that close releases Hikari resources.

## Workshops and learning path

Follow `database-settings`, `rds-iam-and-hikari`, and `transaction-boundaries`, then run the Spring Boot and Ktor Exposed examples.

## Limitations

This module resolves and owns infrastructure; it does not design Exposed tables or move blocking JDBC work off coroutine threads automatically.
