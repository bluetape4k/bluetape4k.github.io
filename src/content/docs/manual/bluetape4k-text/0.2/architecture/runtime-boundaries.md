The modules share a repository but have different initialization, memory, and concurrency behavior. Treat those differences as architecture choices.

## Language detectors

Lingua detectors load language models. Preloading moves work to startup and increases the initial memory footprint; lazy loading defers work until a language is needed. In either mode, construct a detector for the supported language set and reuse it across requests.

Creating an all-language detector per call combines the broadest model set with the worst allocation pattern. Prefer the smallest supported language set and measure startup with your deployment limits.

## Korean and Japanese processors

`KoreanProcessor` and `JapaneseProcessor` are shared facade objects. The Korean API is documented as safe for concurrent use. The Japanese blockword dictionary loads lazily on first access using an IO dispatcher boundary, so the first blockword request can be more expensive than steady state.

If predictable latency matters, exercise the operations you will serve during application warmup. Do not mutate runtime dictionaries casually: additions, removals, and clears change process-wide behavior for later requests.

## Dictionary loading

`DictionaryProvider.readWords` combines multiple resources with coroutine-based asynchronous loading. Call it from a controlled setup coroutine. Resource files may be plain text or gzip-compressed, and the resulting `CharArraySet` is intended for repeated membership checks.

The loader does not define how a cluster distributes policy updates. Persist and version application-owned dictionaries outside the request path when instances must agree.

## Search automatons

`AhoCorasickAutomaton.Builder` is mutable while keywords and options are being assembled. `build()` produces an immutable automaton that can be shared. Rebuilding a large dictionary for every request discards that design advantage and repeats trie and failure-link construction.

`matchesAsFlow` uses a coroutine Flow path on `Dispatchers.Default`. It supports bounded collection such as `take(1)`, but it does not make a CPU-bound search free. Choose the regular methods for immediate in-memory results and Flow when collection and cancellation semantics fit the surrounding pipeline.

## Recommended ownership

| Resource | Recommended lifetime | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| configured `LanguageDetector` | application singleton per language policy | build per request |
| processor facade | shared object | wrapper instances with hidden mutable policy |
| application dictionary set | versioned setup state | disk/network reload per request |
| built Aho-Corasick automaton | shared immutable snapshot | rebuild per request |
| request model | one per accepted request | storing submitted text in error logs |

## Warmup and observability

Warm only the paths you actually use, and measure the result. Useful signals include detector construction time, first-tokenization latency, dictionary size, automaton keyword count, input length, match count, and sanitized failure category. Never attach raw user text to a generic failure metric.

See [startup and memory](/manual/bluetape4k-text/0.2/operations/startup-and-memory/) for a deployment checklist and [input safety](/manual/bluetape4k-text/0.2/guides/input-safety/) for request-boundary rules.
