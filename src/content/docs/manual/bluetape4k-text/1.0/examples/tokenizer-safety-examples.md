This example places a small service-style boundary in front of Korean and Japanese processors. It distinguishes invalid input, oversized input, successful processing, and unexpected processor failure without echoing submitted text.

## Run it

```bash
./gradlew :examples:tokenizer-safety-examples:run
```

The program runs four accepted Korean/Japanese tokenize and blockword calls, then submits an oversized Korean tokenizer value. Accepted lines report language and token or masked length; the oversized line reports status `413`, actual length, and the maximum.

## Boundary order

`TokenizerSafetyHandler` performs checks in this order:

1. text longer than the operation's public maximum → `413`;
2. blank text → `400`;
3. processor call succeeds → `200`;
4. processor throws → sanitized `500`.

The maximum is `MAX_TOKENIZE_TEXT_LENGTH` for tokenization and `MAX_BLOCKWORD_TEXT_LENGTH` for masking. Both are `100_000` in release 1.0.0.

## Injected processor functions

The handler accepts Korean and Japanese functions in its constructor. Tests can force a processor failure without loading a real model and then verify that the response contains `processor error` but not the submitted sentinel.

This design keeps boundary tests fast and separates adapter policy from tokenizer correctness.

## Coroutine caveat

The example wraps synchronous processor calls with `runCatching`. If your injected function becomes `suspend`, replace broad `runCatching` with explicit `try/catch` that rethrows `CancellationException` before handling other exceptions.

## Adapt it to HTTP

Map `SafetyResponse.status` to your framework response and keep `body` free of input. Add transport byte limits before decoding, retain the library character limit after decoding, and attach only a policy-safe request identifier.

## Test cases to retain

- blank and whitespace-only input;
- exactly-at-limit and one-over-limit input;
- each language and each operation;
- injected processor failure;
- sentinel absence in every error and rendered report.
