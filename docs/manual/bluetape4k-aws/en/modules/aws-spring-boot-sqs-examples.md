# Spring Boot SQS and SNS Workshop

> A runnable workshop grounded in the 1.0.0 release source.

## Learning goal {#problem}

Build a Spring Boot 4 messaging path with REST publishing, `@SqsListener`, typed conversion, manual acknowledgement, retry/backoff, interceptor events, SNS-to-SQS fanout, and DLQ redrive setup.

## When to use this workshop {#when-to-use}

Use it before operating annotation-driven SQS listeners or when fanout, redrive, and duplicate-safe handler behavior need one executable reference.

## Project coordinates {#coordinates}

This example is not published. Run `./gradlew :aws-spring-boot-sqs-examples:test`. Applications import the central BOM, `bluetape4k-aws-spring-boot`, and the Java SDK SQS/SNS service modules.

## Concepts to learn {#concepts}

The controller stays thin. `SqsSnsExampleService` owns queue URLs, policies, subscriptions, and redrive attributes. Listeners demonstrate plain messages, typed `OrderPayload`, manual ack, one in-process retry, and interceptor events.

## Staged walkthrough {#quick-start}

1. Create a queue and publish one plain message.
2. Confirm the listener store and interceptor events.
3. Send typed JSON and follow manual acknowledgement.
4. Trigger retry-once behavior and inspect both attempts.
5. Create SNS fanout, publish, then configure a source queue and DLQ.

## Entry points and expected behavior {#api-by-task}

`SpringBootSqsExampleApplication` starts the service. `SqsSnsExampleController` exposes queue creation, send/receive, fanout, SNS publish, DLQ setup, and listener inspection under `/spring/sqs`.

## Recommended exercise order {#patterns}

Make acknowledgement and business idempotency explicit before increasing concurrency. Prefer SQS redrive policy for durable poison-message handling; use in-process retry only for bounded transient failures.

## Integration boundary {#integrations}

Spring auto-configuration owns clients and listener containers. The service owns AWS resource relationships, while `ReceivedOrderStore` is only an in-memory teaching aid.

## Configuration checkpoints {#configuration}

Configure SQS/SNS region and endpoint, listener queue names, poll limits, retry settings, and manual acknowledgement. Production also needs queue policy, redrive policy, visibility, retention, and shutdown budgets.

## Failure modes {#failures}

Duplicate delivery, invalid JSON, missing queue URLs, insufficient SNS-to-SQS policy, visibility expiry, poison messages, and listener shutdown during work are expected failure paths.

## Operations {#operations}

Track receive age, delivery count, retry, ack/nack, DLQ depth, and listener phase latency. Keep message bodies and queue URLs out of metric tags and close containers before clients.

## Testing the boundary {#testing}

`SqsSnsExampleLocalStackTest` supports Floci-first and explicit LocalStack fallback. It verifies queues, listeners, typed/manual ack, retry, events, fanout policy/subscription, publish, and DLQ redrive attributes.

## Next learning path {#workshops}

Compare the Ktor SQS workshop for explicit runtime and observer hooks, then design durable idempotency and failure recovery around the business handler.

## Limitations {#limitations}

The in-memory stores do not survive restart. Emulator success does not prove IAM, production redrive timing, high concurrency, ordering, exactly-once processing, or cross-account fanout.
