# Redis backends

Choose Lettuce for command-level control or Redisson for its client ecosystem while respecting thread-bound ownership.

## Common contract

Both modules provide single, group, suspend, factory, state, and strategic variants. They use owner tokens for conditional release and the shared lease auto-extender. Redis server availability and key expiry are part of the correctness boundary.

## Lettuce

Lettuce exposes sync and coroutine-friendly command paths and is a good fit when the application already owns a Lettuce connection. Validate connection lifecycle and command timeout separately from election `waitTime`.

## Redisson

Redisson integrates with `RLock`/semaphore-style facilities. Some ownership is tied to the acquiring thread; extending from another thread yields `WrongThread`. The 0.5.0 elector passes an explicit lease, so benchmarked `autoExtend` refers to bluetape4k's shared extender, not Redisson's native watchdog mode.
