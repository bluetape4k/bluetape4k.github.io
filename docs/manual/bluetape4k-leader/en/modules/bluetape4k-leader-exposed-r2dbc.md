# Exposed R2DBC backend

> Library module

## Problem {#problem}

Implements coroutine single and group election with Exposed R2DBC transactions while sharing SQL ownership rules with JDBC.

## When to use it {#when-to-use}

Choose it for coroutine-first R2DBC services; choose JDBC when surrounding APIs are blocking or virtual-thread based.

## Coordinates {#coordinates}

Artifact: `io.github.bluetape4k.leader:bluetape4k-leader-exposed-r2dbc`

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.bluetape4k:bluetape4k-dependencies:<version>"))
    implementation("io.github.bluetape4k.leader:bluetape4k-leader-exposed-r2dbc")
}
```

## Core concepts {#concepts}

Suspend transactions perform conditional writes with expiry and owner tokens. Cancellation must clean up only the lease owned by that call.

## Quick start {#quick-start}

```kotlin
val elector = ExposedR2DbcSuspendLeaderElector(database)
elector.runIfLeader("projection-refresh") { refreshProjection() }
```

## API by task {#api-by-task}

Use suspend single/group electors, `R2dbcDatabase` extensions, factories, initializer, and suspend history sink.

## Recommended patterns {#patterns}

Keep acquire/use/release in structured scope, do not hide JDBC blocking calls inside it, and migrate the shared schema first.

## Integrations {#integrations}

Can share a namespace with JDBC when database, schema, and release match. Spring and Ktor consume the suspend factory/elector.

## Configuration {#configuration}

Tune wait, lease, retry, schema, R2DBC pool, statement timeout, and lifecycle ownership.

## Failure modes {#failures}

Contention returns `null`; cancellation rethrows after owner-safe cleanup; connection and transaction failures propagate.

## Operations {#operations}

Observe acquisition latency, pool queue time, retries, cancellation cleanup, and database load.

## Testing {#testing}

Use a real R2DBC database for two-client contention, group slots, expiry, and cancellation during acquire/action.

## Workshops and learning path {#workshops}

Compare JDBC, then run migration-gate and the Ktor example to see lifecycle integration.

## Limitations {#limitations}

R2DBC removes blocked threads, not database round trips or database availability risk.
