# Runtime model

Trace one election from contender entry through ownership, action execution, observation, and release.

![Leader election lease lifecycle](../../assets/architecture/election-lifecycle.png)

## The critical path

An elector validates the lock name, waits up to `waitTime`, and asks its backend to acquire ownership atomically. A failed acquire publishes a skipped signal and returns `null` or `LeaderRunResult.Skipped`. A successful acquire creates a scoped lock handle, publishes elected, runs the action, records completion or failure, then releases only with matching ownership.

## Lease is not a transaction

Leadership prevents another compliant contender from entering the guarded section during the valid lease. It does not roll back external writes and it cannot stop work after a process pause or network partition. The action must therefore be idempotent, and destructive downstream systems should validate a fencing token where available.

## Observation is best effort

`state(lockName)` and event streams help operators understand the system, but they are snapshots. Never read state and then decide that acquisition is safe; only the backend's atomic acquire path owns that decision. `leaseUntil` can be absent or approximate depending on the backend.
