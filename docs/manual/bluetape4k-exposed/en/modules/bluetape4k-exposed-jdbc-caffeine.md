# Exposed JDBC Caffeine Cache

This adapter combines blocking JDBC or suspended JDBC with in-process Caffeine. It implements the common cache repository contract without hiding lifecycle or durability choices.

## Problem {#problem}

Cache and database state can diverge when a miss, write, invalidation, timeout, cancellation, or shutdown completes only partly. The adapter supplies the integration; the application still defines acceptable staleness and failure behavior.

## When to use it {#when-to-use}

Use this module when in-process Caffeine is the chosen backend and the persistence path is blocking JDBC or suspended JDBC. Compare all six adapters in the [cache selection guide](../guides/cache-selection.md) before adding infrastructure.

## Coordinates {#coordinates}

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.bluetape4k:bluetape4k-dependencies:<version>"))
    implementation("io.github.bluetape4k.exposed:bluetape4k-exposed-jdbc-caffeine")
}
```

## Core concepts {#concepts}

`get` and `getAll` are read-through operations. Cache-aside is an application-owned DB update followed by invalidation. True write-through requires the configured writer to finish DB persistence before returning. Write-behind accepts a delayed durability window. Ordinary `put` must not be called write-through without that writer policy. This adapter is local-only; it does not synchronize entries across JVMs.

The stable `2.0.0` adapter owns its JDBC transaction, dispatcher, and Caffeine cache; write-behind remains an explicitly delayed durability mode. The lifecycle coordinator, bounded admission accounting, publication lease, and terminal retry behavior described below are part of the stable `2.0.0` contract.

**2.0.0 write-behind contract:** `writeBehindBatchSize` and `writeBehindQueueCapacity` must each be in `1..100_000`, and queue capacity must be greater than or equal to batch size. Zero, negative, values above `100_000`, or a queue smaller than the batch fail fast with `IllegalArgumentException`. A failed flush is retried at most 8 times with capped exponential backoff from 10 ms to 1 s; the retained batch is not dropped before the retry limit. A terminal failure leaves the worker in `FAILED`; the library does not silently move the retained batch to a durable outbox or dead-letter store.

## Quick start {#quick-start}

Extend `AbstractJdbcCaffeineRepository` and provide `table`, `extractId`, `ResultRow.toEntity`, and the update/insert DSL hooks. Construct it with a reviewed `LocalCacheConfig`.

```kotlin
repository.use { repo ->
    val current = repo.get(id)          // miss -> DB loader -> cache
    current?.let { repo.put(id, it) }   // durability follows write mode
    repo.invalidate(id)                 // cache-only by default
}
```

## API by task {#api-by-task}

| Task | API |
| --- | --- |
| Cache-backed read | `containsKey`, `get`, `getAll` |
| DB bypass | `findByIdFromDb`, `findAllFromDb`, `countFromDb` |
| Policy-controlled write | `put`, `putAll` |
| Eviction | `invalidate`, `invalidateAll`, `clear` |
| Entity mapping | `ResultRow.toEntity`, `extractId`, update/insert hooks |
| Lifecycle | `close` |

## Recommended patterns {#patterns}

Keep one repository per cache namespace and close it with the application. For cache-aside, commit the DB transaction before invalidating. Treat write-through failure as an incomplete write. Before write-behind, expose queue state and define the shutdown drain budget. `putAll` processes entries in input order; if an entry fails, earlier effects remain visible and the exception identifies the failing operation—there is no implicit rollback. After an accepted queue handoff, a cache publication failure invalidates that key. Keep key prefixes and serialized value formats stable.

## Integrations {#integrations}

The module joins Exposed JDBC, the shared cache foundation, and in-process Caffeine. Loader/writer adapters own the cache-to-table bridge; the application owns the surrounding service transaction and client lifecycle.

## Configuration {#configuration}

`LocalCacheConfig` controls namespace, TTL/expiry, cache/write mode, and backend limits. Values remain in-process, so no Redis wire codec is used. Validate positive durations and bounded batch/queue sizes at startup.

## Failure modes {#failures}

A full write-behind channel rejects the operation before updating the cache. Process failure can still lose accepted entries not yet flushed. A cache hit can be stale, a backend success can be followed by DB failure, and DB commit can be followed by failed invalidation. Record these as distinct states. For durable retry or dead-letter recovery, the application must own the outbox schema, replay/idempotency policy, alerting, and operator runbook; coordinator `FAILED` is an observation boundary, not a durable recovery mechanism.

## Operations {#operations}

The repository owns the Caffeine cache and bounded write-behind scope. In the develop implementation, `close()` first stops new admissions, attempts publication and worker drain within a finite shutdown boundary, and then invalidates the cache; timeout or interruption can leave a residual batch or failure for operators to observe. Monitor hit/miss, backend latency, retries/timeouts, queue depth, rejected writes, invalidation lag, and shutdown drain. Set separate SLOs for cache and database paths.

## Testing {#testing}

Use isolated cache and database fixtures with unique namespaces. Prove miss loading, partial `getAll` misses, each enabled write mode, cache-only invalidation, TTL, partial failure, and lifecycle cleanup.

```bash
./gradlew :bluetape4k-exposed-jdbc-caffeine:test
```

## Workshops and learning path {#workshops}

1. Read [Exposed cache foundation](bluetape4k-exposed-cache.md).
2. Choose a backend in [cache selection](../guides/cache-selection.md).
3. Implement read-through plus cache-only invalidation first.
4. Add partial-failure and shutdown tests before near cache or write-behind.
5. Continue with [exposed-workshop](https://github.com/bluetape4k/exposed-workshop).

## Limitations {#limitations}

The adapter does not create a distributed transaction, provision the backend, migrate stored cache values, or decide whether stale data is safe. It is local-only; it does not synchronize entries across JVMs.
