# bluetape4k-javers 0.2 manual

Object auditing becomes difficult when application state, audit history, and query projections are treated as one store. `bluetape4k-javers` 0.3.0 gives Kotlin services a JaVers audit layer with Exposed, Redis, and Kafka adapters, but each adapter has a different responsibility. This manual starts with those boundaries so that a service does not accidentally use a cache or stream as its only recoverable record.

## Core capabilities

- **Audit snapshots and diffs:** The [audit model](architecture/audit-model.md) explains JaVers commits, snapshots, changes, shadows, and the query semantics built on them.
- **DDD aggregate history:** [javers-ddd](modules/javers-ddd.md) and the [DDD/CQRS guide](guides/ddd-and-cqrs.md) connect aggregate commands and domain events to explicit JaVers commits.
- **Relational persistence:** [Exposed persistence](persistence/exposed.md) stores recoverable CDO snapshots in a JDBC database without replacing the application's own Exposed repositories.
- **Redis and Kafka adapters:** [Redis](persistence/redis.md) supports cache/read-model paths, while [Kafka](persistence/kafka.md) publishes audit records for downstream consumers; neither silently becomes the business source of truth.
- **Failure and observability contracts:** [Failure contracts](operations/failure-contracts.md) and [observability](operations/observability.md) define partial-write, retry, lag, and recovery signals.
- **Runnable learning and comparison:** The [Exposed DDD example](examples/javers-exposed-ddd.md) and [JaVers/Exposed DDD/Envers comparison](benchmarks/exposed-ddd-envers.md) connect the abstractions to code and measured evidence.

The manual is pinned to release `0.3.0` (`978d0490fc438570e7520643aed50e20614772d1`). Ktor integration, Spring Boot 4 auto-configuration and examples, and the dedicated Gradle benchmark module were added after that release. They are not 0.2 features.

## Learning map

[![Repository learning map](../assets/overview/repository-learning-map.png)](../assets/overview/repository-learning-map.svg)

## Start here

- [Getting started](getting-started.md) installs a coherent ecosystem dependency set and creates a small Exposed-backed JaVers instance.
- [Repository map](architecture/repository-map.md) shows which module owns audit semantics, persistence, and event publication.
- [Persistence selection](persistence/selection-guide.md) compares Exposed, Redis, and Kafka by recovery and query needs.
- [Learning path](guides/learning-path.md) orders the material for application developers, library integrators, and operators.

## Use the manual by question

If you need to understand JaVers data, read [the audit model](architecture/audit-model.md). If you are composing storage, cache, or publication paths, read [repository composition](architecture/repository-composition.md) and [failure contracts](operations/failure-contracts.md). For a command-to-projection example, follow [DDD and CQRS](guides/ddd-and-cqrs.md). For production proof, use [testing](guides/testing.md) and [observability](operations/observability.md).

## Architecture, persistence, and operations

- [Audit model](architecture/audit-model.md) separates commits, snapshots, changes, and shadows.
- [Repository composition](architecture/repository-composition.md) explains the source-of-truth and adapter boundaries.
- [Persistence selection](persistence/selection-guide.md) compares the recovery contract of Exposed, Redis, and Kafka.
- [Exposed](persistence/exposed.md), [Redis](persistence/redis.md), and [Kafka](persistence/kafka.md) document each adapter in depth.
- [Failure contracts](operations/failure-contracts.md) and [observability](operations/observability.md) turn those boundaries into operational checks.

## Modules and runnable material
