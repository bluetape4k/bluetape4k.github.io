# Text BOM

The Text BOM aligns versions for the five published runtime libraries. It contains dependency constraints only: importing it does not add a tokenizer, detector, or search API to your classpath.

## What it provides

- one version for `tokenizer-core`, `tokenizer-korean`, `tokenizer-japanese`, `lingua`, and `text-search`;
- Gradle platform and Maven dependency-management compatibility;
- a Text-only alternative when the wider `bluetape4k-dependencies` BOM is not appropriate.

## Add the dependency

Prefer the ecosystem BOM when your application consumes libraries from several bluetape4k repositories:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.bluetape4k:bluetape4k-dependencies:<release>"))
    implementation("io.github.bluetape4k.text:lingua")
    implementation("io.github.bluetape4k.text:text-search")
}
```

Import the Text BOM directly when you intentionally manage only this repository's artifacts:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("io.github.bluetape4k.text:bluetape4k-text-bom:1.0.0"))
    implementation("io.github.bluetape4k.text:tokenizer-korean")
}
```

## How it works

The BOM is a Gradle `java-platform` project. Its published POM contributes dependency-management constraints. Runtime classes remain in the five library artifacts, so a build that imports only the BOM will compile no Text API calls.

## When to choose it

Choose `bluetape4k-dependencies` for normal ecosystem applications. Choose `bluetape4k-text-bom` when Text has an intentionally independent release policy in your build. Avoid declaring versions on individual Text modules after importing either BOM; doing so bypasses the alignment you selected.

## Constraints

The BOM aligns compatible coordinates but cannot validate your runtime composition. It also does not add optional coroutines support required by the `text-search` Flow extension in applications that call it.
